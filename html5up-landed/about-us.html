										<h3>History</h3>
										<p>West-Indies Constructions, formerly known as Bamidele & Sons Construction Company, was founded in 2004 by John Bamidele. 
											The company began with small projects that were funded by Mr. Bamidele's lucky MMM cashout.</p>
										<p> Following Mr. Bamidele's death, the masonry operation was phased out and the emphasis shifted to commercial, industrial, and institutional building projects. 
											Mr. Bamidele's immediate relatives took over the company in 2007 and guided it to where it is today. 
											The company's success can be attributed to its employees' commitment to high-quality work, exceptional customer service, 
											and a safety program that has resulted in millions of zero-accident hours.</p>
										<h3>Awards</h3>
